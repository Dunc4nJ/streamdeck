## Row 0

### [0,0] New Term

### [0,1] (no title)

```
Ok can you now turn your attention to reviewing the code written by your fellow agents and checking for any issues, bugs, errors, problems, inefficiencies, security problems, reliability issues, etc. and carefully diagnose their underlying root causes using first-principle analysis and then fix or revise them if necessary? Don't restrict yourself to the latest commits, cast a wider net and go super deep! Use ultrathink.
```

### [0,2] Default New

```
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project. Then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents. Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages. Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. When you're not sure what to do next, us the bv tool mentioned in AGENTS.md to prioritize the best beads to work on next; pick the next one that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names. *CRITICAL*: All cargo builds and tests and other CPU intensive operations MUST be done using rch to offload them!!! see AGENTS.md for details on how to do this!!!
```

### [0,3] READ 
& CONTINUE

```
I need you to SUPER CAREFULLY read absolutely ALL of this and then pick up from where you left off at the end:
```

---

## Row 1

### [1,0] (no title)

```
OK, so start systematically and methodically and meticulously and diligently executing those remaining beads tasks that you created in the optimal logical order! Don't forget to mark beads as you work on them.
```

### [1,1] reread agents

```
Reread AGENTS.md so it's still fresh in your mind.
```

### [1,2] (no title)

```
Pick the next bead you can actually do usefully now and start coding on it immediately; communicate what you're working on to your fellow agents and mark beads appropriately as you work. And respond to any agent mail messages you've received.
```

### [1,3] Use BV

```
Use bv with the robot flags (see AGENTS.md for info on this) to find the most impactful bead(s) to work on next and then start on it. Remember to mark the beads appropriately and communicate with your fellow agents.
```

---

## Row 2

### [2,0] (no title)

```
OK so please take ALL of that and elaborate on it more and then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid, with detailed comments so that the whole thing is totally self-contained and self-documenting (including relevant background, reasoning/justification, considerations, etc.-- anything we'd want our "future self" to know about the goals and intentions and thought process and how it serves the over-arching goals of the project.)
```

### [2,1] (no title)

```
What's the single smartest and most radically innovative and accretive and useful and compelling addition you could make to the plan at this point
```

### [2,2] (no title)

```
Great, now I want you to super carefully scrutinize every aspect of the application workflow and implementation and look for things that just seem sub-optimal or even wrong/mistaken to you, things that could very obviously be improved from a user-friendliness and intuitiveness standpoint, places where our UI/UX could be improved and polished to be slicker, more visually appealing, and more premium feeling and just ultra high quality, like Stripe-level apps.
```

### [2,3] (no title)

```
great, now I want you to carefully read over all of the new code you just wrote and other existing code you just modified with "fresh eyes" looking super carefully for any obvious bugs, errors, problems, issues, confusion, etc. Carefully fix anything you uncover.
```

---

## Row 3

### [3,0] (no title)

```
What else can we put in there to make the README longer and more detailed about what we built, why it's useful, how it works, the algorithms/design principles used, etc. This is incremental NEW content, not replacement for what is there already.
```

### [3,1] (no title)

```
Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages; then proceed meticulously with your next assigned beads, working on the tasks systematically and meticulously and tracking your progress via beads and agent mail messages. Don't get stuck in "communication purgatory" where nothing is getting done; be proactive about starting tasks that need to be done, but inform your fellow agents via messages when you do so and mark beads appropriately. When you're really not sure what to do, pick the next bead that you can usefully work on and get started. Make sure to acknowledge all communication requests from other agents and that you are aware of all active agents and their names. Use ultrathink.
```

### [3,2] (no title)

```
We need to revise the README too for these changes (don't write about these as "changes" however, make it read like it was always like that, we don't have any users yet!)
```

### [3,3] Improve UX

```
Do a thorough UI/UX improvement pass aiming for true world-class, Stripe-level polish. Consider desktop and mobile separately and hyper-optimize for each modality. Focus on making everything more intuitive, visually stunning, user-friendly, and slick — leveraging the good libraries already in the project.
```

## Row 4

### [4,0] (no title)

```
Read about the ubs tool in AGENTS.md. Now run UBS and investigate and fix literally every single UBS issue once you determine (after reasoned consideration and close inspection) that it's legit.
```

### [4,1] (no title)

```
First read ALL of the AGENTS.md file and README.md file super carefully and understand ALL of both! Then use your code investigation agent mode to fully understand the code, and technical architecture and purpose of the project.
```

### [4,2] (no title)

```
Check over each bead super carefully-- are you sure it makes sense? Is it optimal? Could we change anything to make the system work better for users? If so, revise the beads. It's a lot easier and faster to operate in "plan space" before we start implementing these things!
```

### [4,3] (no title)

```
What else can we put in there to make the README longer and more detailed about what we built, why it's useful, how it works, the algorithms/design principles used, etc. This is incremental NEW content, not replacement for what is there already.
```

---

## Row 5

### [5,0] (no title)

```
Re-read AGENTS.md first. Then, can you try using bv to get some insights on what each agent should most usefully work on? Then share those insights with the other agents via agent mail and strongly suggest in your messages the optimal work for each one and explain how/why you came up with that using bv. Use ultrathink.
```

### [5,1] (no title)

```
Before doing anything else, read ALL of AGENTS.md, then register with MCP Agent Mail and introduce yourself to the other agents.
```

### [5,2] PROCEED

```
proceed
```

### [5,3] (no title)

```
I asked 3 competing LLMs to do the exact same thing and they came up with pretty different plans which you can read below. I want you to REALLY carefully analyze their plans with an open mind and be intellectually honest about what they did that's better than your plan. Then I want you to come up with the best possible revisions to your plan (you should simply update your existing document for your original plan with the revisions) that artfully and skillfully blends the "best of all worlds" to create a true, ultimate, superior hybrid version of the plan that best achieves our stated goals and will work the best in real-world practice to solve the problems we are facing and our overarching goals while ensuring the extreme success of the enterprise as best as possible; you should provide me with a complete series of git-diff style changes to your original plan to turn it into the new, enhanced, much longer and detailed plan that integrates the best of all the plans with every good idea included (you don't need to mention which ideas came from which models in the final revised enhanced plan):
```

## Row 6

### [6,0] (no title)

```
Be sure to check your agent mail and to promptly respond if needed to any messages, and also acknowledge any contact requests; make sure you know the names of all active agents using the MCP Agent Mail system.
```

### [6,1] Dueling
Wizards

### [6,2] (no title)

```
Now, based on your knowledge of the project, commit all changed files now in a series of logically connected groupings with super detailed commit messages for each and then push. Take your time to do it right. Don't edit the code at all. Don't commit obviously ephemeral files. Use ultrathink.
```

### [6,3] (no title)

```
Then after extensive exploration, deep analysis, and initial ideas and formulation, please begin an in depth Q and A interview phase where you ask me extensive questions on every aspect of the plan from design specifications to scope and so on. We will follow this loop in the Q & A phase where you will ask questions using the AskUserQuestionTool, review my feedback, deeply analyze, use explore agents where necessary to gather more information based on my feedback, iterate your ideas for the plan, refine, and then ask the next set of questions. Continue this loop until there is zero uncertainty or anything your are unsure about left in your design specifications and scope and I give explicit approval to stop the Q & A phase and begin writing out the full plan.
```

## Row 7

### [7,0] Opt. BE

```
I want you to scour this entire project high and low looking for any redundant, duplicative code, components, etc.-- especially multiple, conflicting ways of doing the same basic thing. If you uncover anything like that, I want you very very carefully review ALL relevant code files and then find the single best canonical examplar to retain (or combine the best elements you see in terms of code, design, etc) to create a single canonical "best" version of the code file(s) that implement that functioanlity, ensure that it's all properly wired and and connected to the rest of the code and the endpoints/API, and then finally remove completely the now irrelevant "stranded" code to avoid confusion and tech debt in this project. Make sure to carefully read the AGENTS.md file and to follow all the python fastapi best practices shown in the guide referenced in that AGENTS.md file. Make very sure that you aren't, in the course of these changes, breaking any API contracts or losing critical features or functionality.
```

### [7,1] DO IT!
w/ TODO

```
OK, please do ALL of that now. Keep a super detailed, granular, and complete TODO list of all items so you don't lose track of anything and remember to complete all the tasks and sub-tasks you identified or which you think of during the course of your work on these items!
```

### [7,2] (no title)

```
Do we have full unit test coverage without using mocks/fake stuff? What about complete e2e integration test scripts with great, detailed logging? If not, then create a comprehensive and granular set of beads for all this with tasks, subtasks, and dependency structure overlaid with detailed comments.
```

### [7,3] Random
Inspect

```
I want you to sort of randomly explore the code files in this project, choosing code files to deeply investigate and understand and trace their functionality and execution flows through the related code files which they import or which they are imported by. Once you understand the purpose of the code in the larger context of the workflows, I want you to do a super careful, methodical, and critical check with "fresh eyes" to find any obvious bugs, problems, errors, issues, silly mistakes, etc. and then systematically and meticulously and intelligently correct them. Be sure to comply with ALL rules in AGENTS.md and ensure that any code you write or revise conforms to the best practice guides referenced in the AGENTS.md file.
```
